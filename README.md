# Hi, I'm Akshay 👋

I build software that’s simple, fast, and practical.

I’m currently focused on:
- Crafting clean developer tools  
- Automating repetitive workflows  
- Building useful products with calm, minimal design  

I enjoy working across the stack when needed, but I care more about clarity and outcomes than collecting tech buzzwords.

If you like building things that solve real problems, let’s connect.
