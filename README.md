# Hey, I'm Akshay 👋

I write code that *usually* works on the first try.  
(On the second try for sure.)

I like building:
- Tools that save developers from developer problems  
- Automations that do the boring stuff so I don’t have to  
- Products that look simple but magically do a lot  

I don't chase every new tech trend.
I just use whatever gets the job done without burning my brain.

If you enjoy solving real problems without pretending to be a 10x ninja rockstar wizard engineer.
we’ll get along great. 😄
